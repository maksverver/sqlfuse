Next:
  - Implement some functions, add some unit tests!
  - sqlfs.c: set passwords & parameters (see TODO in sqlfs_create)
  - sqlfs.c: Maybe: separate functions to create/open existing database?
  - If creating the database fails, should we delete the partially-created
    database file (which will be empty)

Things to test:
  - open read-only file
  - re-open existing file, verify contents are still there.
  - sqlfs tests with encryption (no setup/teardown)

TBD:
  - what should the uid/gid/mode of the root directory be?
  - should we apply the umask manually, or does the kernel handle this?
    (test it with mkdir once that works!)

Decisions to document somewhere:
  - ctime and atime are not stored. (They're not very useful.)

General TODO:
  - create a README with some information and usage notes.
  - fully document the schema definition (wait until the implementation is
    further along; no point documenting it when it's likely to change)
  - fsck tool that checks internal consistency?
