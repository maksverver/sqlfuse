Things to test:
  - open read-only file

main():
  - add separate option for empty password (-n?) and exit with error if an
    empty password is supplied
  - add separate option for creating a new database. Check that target file
    exists iff. option is absent; exit with error otherwise. This prevents
    errors like doing `sqlfuse -s bla.db mnt` which silently creates a file
    called `-s` because the option is in the wrong place.
  - move usage info to NOTES.txt
